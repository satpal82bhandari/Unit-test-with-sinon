## Installation
```
 Run 'npm install'

```

## Testing

```
 Run `npm test` from the root of the project to run linting checks as well as unit tests and generate code-coverage report.

 Note : Default loggging level for test execution is 'OFF'. To enable logging Go to each spec and change logger.loglevel = 1 to logger.loglevel = getLogLevel(). This will set logging level for testing same as logging level to app. Logging level of app can be configured in conf/logger.json

 ```
